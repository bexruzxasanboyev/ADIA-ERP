/**
 * Principal access + location-scope guard helpers.
 *
 * `authenticate` attaches `req.auth`; these helpers read it with a definite
 * (non-undefined) type and enforce the location-scoped half of RBAC
 * (invariant 6 — "a store sees only its own data").
 *
 * F4.1 / ADR-0012 — multi-location (M:N) extension:
 *   - `principal.locationIds` carries every location the user is assigned
 *     to (primary + secondary). PM (chain-wide) gets an empty array — the
 *     `isSuperAdmin` branch handles them.
 *   - `principal.activeLocationId` is the request-scoped context: the
 *     `X-Active-Location` header takes precedence over the primary
 *     `locationId`. The header is validated against `locationIds` —
 *     anything outside the user's assigned set is a 403.
 *   - `assertLocationAccess` now accepts ANY assigned location.
 *   - `getEffectiveLocationIds` is the helper RBAC-scoped SQL uses to
 *     decide which ids to filter by — see callers in `routes/stock.ts`,
 *     `routes/replenishment.ts`, etc.

/**
 * Hardened RBAC guard for **write** actions (owner-approved 2026-05-28).
 *
 * Two enforcement axes — both must pass for the operator to proceed:
 *
 *   1. PM (super-admin) is **never** allowed to perform a business write
 *      action. The owner's rule: PM is read-and-recommend across the chain;
 *      every "do" must be the responsible location's operator. Even though
 *      PM has chain-wide visibility, it must NOT bypass `(product,location)`
 *      ownership for stock movements, replenishment cancels, production
 *      orders, purchase approvals, etc. Configuration endpoints (users,
 *      locations, products, admin, stock minmax) are explicitly exempt and
 *      gated by `authorize('pm', ...)` elsewhere.
 *
 *   2. A scoped operator must own the target location — i.e.
 *      `targetLocationId` must be one of `principal.locationIds`. The M:N
 *      assignment from F4.1 / ADR-0012 still applies: a manager assigned to
 *      multiple stores may act on any of them.
 *
 * Both 403s are best-effort audit-logged so a downstream reviewer can spot
 * misconfigured operators (or attempted privilege escalation) in the audit
 * trail. Audit failures must not turn into 5xx, so the write is wrapped in
 * a catch-all.
